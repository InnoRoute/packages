This folder contains scripts and configuration files for the TrustNode.
All file names are lowercase, except for user-facing scripts,
which have the uppercase prefix TN_
This way users can type TN_ and then use <tab> to see all available scripts.
The naming of these scripts is mostly TN_<physical unit>[_class].sh
